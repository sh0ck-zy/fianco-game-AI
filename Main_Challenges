# Main Challenges in Fianco Game AI

## Efficient Move Generation
- Generating all possible moves, especially captures, can be computationally expensive.
- **Challenge**: Optimize the move generation algorithm to reduce the branching factor.

## Evaluation Function
- Balancing different factors (progress, flank control, piece count) in the evaluation function.
- **Challenge**: Fine-tuning the weights for these factors to create a strong AI.

## Search Depth
- The 9x9 board and complex movement rules may lead to a high branching factor.
- **Challenge**: Determining the optimal search depth that balances performance and computation time.

## Capture Chains
- Handling multiple captures in a single turn can complicate the move generation and evaluation.
- **Challenge**: Efficiently representing and evaluating capture sequences.

## Opening Book
- Creating a strong opening strategy, given the importance of flank control.
- **Challenge**: Developing and integrating an effective opening book.

## Endgame Play
- Recognizing and optimizing play in endgame scenarios.
- **Challenge**: Implementing specialized evaluation and search techniques for endgame positions.
